One of the use cases of GenoML is target identification. It is a beneficial side effect of any ML model. The tool is designed to support identification and prioritization of potential interventional targets for follow-up. GenoML generally outputs the feature importances of a model (if you specify the `feature_selection` option at `munge`) allowing you to prioritize what might have the most impact on predicting your phenotype of interest. In future development cycles, we'll be adding a ton more features to help with model interpretability, particularly when it relates to the features that "make your model tick".
