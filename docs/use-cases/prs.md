title: "Polygenic Risk Score (PRS)"
---

One of the use cases of GenoML is Polygenic Risk Score (PRS). PRS is a number that summarises the estimated effect of many genetic variants on an individual's phenotype, typically calculated as a weighted sum of trait-associated alleles.It reflects an individuals estimated genetic predisposition for a given trait and can be used as a predictor for that trait. Polygenic scores are widely used in animal breeding and plant breeding (usually termed genomic prediction or genomic selection) due to their efficacy in improving livestock breeding and crops. They are also increasingly being used for risk prediction in humans for complex diseases which are typically affected by many genetic variants that each confer a small effect on overall risk.
