We are staunch advocates of open science, striving to make data and code easily accessible to the scientific community.

- **Little to Learn** - The goal of GenoML is to democratize complex genomics and machine learning workflows. If you can 'cd' or 'ls', you should be able to use GenoML.

- **Intuitive** - We hope that everything is simple, straightforward, and effective. From data munging to a tuned model in 3 lines of code.

- **Layered Architecture** - GenoML is s more than a tool; it is a community that will be continuously growing, experimenting with new ideas and innovations. We keep workflows in logical layers to change or update one module and not affect the others.

- **Sensible Defaults** - Nobody likes having to think too much. We've locked in the sensible default settings for most workflows to keep modules un-cluttered and running smoothly.

- **No Vendor Lock-in** - Integrate GenoML with your other code, other products, other platforms. GenoML is open source and will remain.
