GenoML developers advocate open science. The following are the underlying principles of GenoML development:

- **Little to learn** - The goal of GenoML is to democratize complex genomics and machine learning workflows. Thoughtfully designed for newcomers, if a user can `cd` or `ls`, they should be able to use GenoML.

- **Intuitive** - Everything has to be simple, straightforward, and effective, from data munging to a tuned model in a few lines of code.

- **Layered architecture** - GenoML is more than a tool; it is an ecosystem that will continuously grow, experimenting with new ideas and innovations. Workflows are kept in logical layers; to change or update one module and not affect the others.

- **Intelligent defaults** - Systematic research is done to set optimized defaults for varying inputs. The default settings are sensible and validated for most workflows to keep modules un-cluttered and to run smoothly. At the same time, providing manual options for advanced users.

- **No vendor lock-in** - Integration with other code, products, and platforms should be hassle-free. GenoML is open source and will remain free and public under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

- **Safe and inclusive community** - GenoML is a community for positivity in research and open science for the public good. [Code of Conduct](/docs/about/contribute) is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant, version 2.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/).
