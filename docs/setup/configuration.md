You can test GenoML on an example dataset. To install the `examples/` directory (~315 KB), you can use SVN (pre-installed on most Macs)

`svn export https://github.com/GenoML/genoml2.git/trunk/examples`

> Note: When you pip install this package, the examples/ folder is also downloaded! However, if  you still want to download the directory and SVN is not pre-installed, you can download it via Homebrew if you have that installed using `brew install svn`
